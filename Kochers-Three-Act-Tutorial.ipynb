    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1996, Paul Kocher published [a seminal paper](https://paulkocher.com/doc/TimingAttacks.pdf) demonstrating that the execution time of cryptographic operations could leak information about secret keys. This wasn't a mathematical weakness in the abstract cryptographic algorithms, but rather a side-channel attack that exploited implementation details of real cryptographic systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial explores timing attacks through three progressive implementations, each revealing different aspects of the challenge. We first start with a simple instruction cost model to illustrate the core dynamics of the attack. We then move on to actual timing measurements on more realistic implementations and show the challenges presented by modern processors and operating systems. Finally, we show some engineering techniques to recover the key signal from noisy measurements. This progression illustrates both the theoretical foundations and practical engineering challenges of side-channel cryptanalysis.\n",

Intuitively this could leak the hamming weight of a key (i.e. the number of 1s in the binary representation of the key). In this section we demonstrate, using a basic implementation based on simple trial subtraction cost modeling, that this apparently small issue can lead to the full leakage of a key.\n",

Real hardware multiplications followed by modular reduction take variable time depending on the operands. We capture this idea with a trial subtraction cost model: every modular multiplication costs one multiply plus as many subtractions as needed to reduce the product below the modulus. This toy model is simple but already produces the kind of pseudo-random timing variation that Kocher’s attack can exploit."

When the product of two numbers is close to the modulus, only a few subtractions are needed to reduce it, resulting in a low cost. In contrast, when the product is much larger than the modulus, many subtractions are required, leading to a higher cost. Because these products depend on both the input message and the evolving intermediate values during exponentiation, the timing variation appears pseudo-random, just as in real modular arithmetic implementations. In other words:\n",

    "This demonstration highlights the fundamental statistical structure that underpins Kocher's attack. The cost of modular exponentiation is not constant across messages; instead, it exhibits meaningful variation, sometimes requiring significantly more or fewer operations. When aggregated over many runs, these costs follow a roughly normal distribution, reflecting the central limit theorem at work in the sum of many small operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason timing variation can be turned into a full attack is that it provides a real, exploitable signal about the secret key. The normal distribution emerges from the central limit theorem: if each round's timing is an independent random variable, then the sum of many rounds naturally converges to a normal distribution. This independence between rounds is a crucial assumption underlying Kocher's variance distinguisher: it allows us to decompose the total variance into separate contributions from different parts of the computation. As we'll demonstrate next, this independence assumption can be validated empirically, confirming the mathematical foundation for statistical timing attacks.\n",

As we will discuss in more detail later, this allows us to decompose variance as $\\text{Var}[A + B] = \\text{Var}[A] + \\text{Var}[B]$ when A and B are independent. But is this assumption valid in practice? Let's test it empirically.\n",

In real RSA exponents the least significant bit is always 1, since the private key must be odd. This makes it natural to assume the first round is known in advance. For simplicity of exposition, we adopt the same assumption here.

    "The intuition behind the signal-to-noise calculation is simple: if the extra multiplication (bit=1) consistently takes longer than the no-multiplication case (bit=0), then the signal is the average difference between the two means. But since each measurement is perturbed by operating system scheduling, cache effects, and other runtime noise, the noise is captured by the variability (standard deviation) within each set of measurements. If the signal is small compared to the noise, the timing difference is effectively drowned out; if it is large, an attacker could, in principle, detect the hidden bit."

    "These experiments illustrate why naive timing attacks fail under realistic conditions. The timing difference introduced by an extra multiplication in the $bit=1$ case is small compared to the variability in wall-clock measurements. In practice, the random noise introduced by the interpreter, operating system scheduling, caching, and hardware effects is often several times larger than the signal itself. As a result, the signal-to-noise ratio is low, and the useful information is effectively drowned out by randomness. This means that without additional techniques—such as amplification, filtering, or more precise timing sources—an attacker cannot reliably distinguish between key bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even when amplification is applied, the variance across runs remains dominated by noise. Repetition should in theory average out randomness, but in practice the system-level variability persists, making the extra cost of a single multiply indistinguishable. This highlights the fundamental challenge of exploiting wall-clock timing directly: the leakage is present in principle, but obscured in practice by measurement noise.\n",

We may sometimes be lucky and guess the correct bit, but if we run this a couple times we see how unreliable the prediction is, as expected due to the signal noise. It seems though as if there is some signal there! Should we just sample more messages, do more amplification, both? How much further do we need to tweak our attack to recover the signal in practice?"

    "# Part 3: Engineering a Robust Timing Attack\n",
    "\n",
    "In Part 2, we discovered that wall-clock timing measurements introduce significant noise that undermines our statistical analysis. The clean theoretical results from Part 1 gave way to frustrating inconsistencies when confronted with real-world measurement artifacts: thermal drift, CPU frequency scaling, cache effects, and operating system interference all conspired to obscure the subtle timing differences we needed to detect.\n",
    "\n",
    "The natural engineering response is amplification through repetition—running thousands of iterations and averaging the results until the signal emerges from the noise. This approach has merit and forms the foundation of many practical timing attacks. Yet amplification alone, while necessary, proves insufficient for reliable attacks. Even with high amplification factors, systematic measurement biases and drift can still lead our statistical distinguisher astray.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we need is a more sophisticated approach that not only amplifies the signal but also actively cancels the sources of bias that plague wall-clock measurements. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "While amplification helps, reliable timing attacks require a comprehensive approach to measurement hygiene that addresses multiple sources of noise and bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, even with careful measurement, timing data inevitably contains outliers—measurements corrupted by OS interrupts, cache misses, or thermal throttling events. Rather than using arbitrary percentile trimming, we employ the Interquartile Range (IQR) method implemented in our `iqr_filter()` function. This principled statistical approach removes measurements outside $[Q1 - factor \\times IQR, Q3 + factor \\times IQR]$ while ensuring we retain at least 50% of our data. The IQR method is more robust than simple percentile cuts because it adapts to the actual distribution of measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, Python's garbage collector introduces unpredictable timing spikes that can dwarf the subtle differences we're trying to measure. Our `measure_timing_simple()` function systematically disables GC during critical measurements using `gc.disable()`, then restores the original state afterward. This eliminates a major source of measurement noise that could easily overwhelm our signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last, we incorporate brief sleep periods (1ms) between measurement runs and warm-up iterations before actual timing. The warm-up phase allows CPU caches, branch predictors, and thermal states to stabilize, ensuring our measurements reflect the steady-state behavior rather than transient effects. The sleep periods prevent thermal buildup and allow CPU frequency scaling to settle, reducing systematic drift across our measurement sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "These techniques, when combined with amplification, create the controlled measurement environment necessary for reliable timing attack implementation."

    "In order to keep this demonstration reproducible we will assume a longer known prefix of a key. We use a 12 bit test key, and assume the first\n",
    "7 bits are known. We will use 1200 messages and an amplification factor of 1000, and for each message we will repeat amplification 3 times and take the average. On each round, we will use the 80% messages with bigger delta between the two hypothesis. We will attempt to recover the next 3 bits (bits 8 to 11), which gives us a good idea of the reliability of the approach ($\\frac{1}{8}$ guessing probability for one attempt, and $\\frac{1}{64}$ for two independent attempts in a row). Note that the same principles can be used to attack lower bits, but we will need bigger amplification and number of messages, which will take longer to run.\n",

    "# Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "Kocher’s 1996 timing attack against fast exponentiation, as used for example for Diffie-Hellman and RSA illustrates a fundamental truth: cryptographic security depends not only on the mathematics but also on the implementation. The square-and-multiply algorithm leaks information because of its data-dependent branch: every time a secret key bit is $1$ the program performs an extra modular multiplication that changes its execution time. In an idealized setting this leak is obvious, and statistical techniques such as variance analysis allow the recovery of secret key bits with high confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, reproducing this attack requires more than the basic algorithm. Real systems introduce noise from operating systems, schedulers, caches, and frequency scaling, which can overwhelm the tiny timing differences. Our experiments showed that naïve wall-clock measurements often fail, but with careful engineering (amplification, filtering, message selection, and system hygiene) the attack can succeed. The broader lesson is twofold: attackers must treat side-channel exploitation as a measurement science, while defenders must eliminate data-dependent control flow and adopt constant-time countermeasures."
